Welcome to PreloadService!

It's a loading module that's open source and highly custom, built fo Roblox although anybody can view and contribute here.

Get the working build [here](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/preloadservice-customizable-way-to-load-assets-via-contentprovider-v2/1663119)

Besides that, as I said, you can contribute and view the code here.
